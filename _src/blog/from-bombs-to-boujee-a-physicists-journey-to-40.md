So, I just turned 40. It's a big milestone, and it's got me thinking about my life so far and where I want to go from here. It's been quite a journey, full of ups and downs, but I'm grateful for all the experiences that have brought me to where I am today.

I was born in Iran right after the 1979 revolution and during the Iran-Iraq war, which made for a pretty tumultuous childhood. I remember hearing bombs exploding in the distance and feeling the fear and uncertainty that comes with living in a war zone.

As if that weren't enough, my family also went through some difficult times, with a lot of trauma and upheaval that left its mark on all of us. But we persevered, and I learned from an early age that I was stronger than I thought.

After high school, I decided to pursue my education in the best university in the country, the University of Tehran. I studied physics and continued on that path until I earned a master's degree in Gravitation and Astrophysics.

But I knew I wanted to keep learning and growing, so I decided to pursue my Ph.D. in physics in the United States. I arrived in the U.S. with no family and not much money, but I was determined to make a better life for myself.

It wasn't easy. I faced a lot of challenges as an immigrant, from language barriers to culture shock. But I didn't give up. I continued to pursue my education, and I eventually earned my Ph.D. in physics from Washington University in St. Louis.

Along the way, I had the opportunity to spend time at some of the best institutions in the world, including MIT, Caltech, and the University of Florida. After my Ph.D., I worked as a post-doc for LIGO, the Nobel-prize-winning collaboration that made the first direct detection of gravitational waves.

It was during this time that I experienced a difficult divorce that left me feeling heartbroken and alone. But I didn't let it defeat me. I continued to pursue my passion for data science, and eventually landed a job at Mastercard as a Director of Data Science and a people leader.

And in the midst of all this, I found love again, and my two beautiful dogs, Boujee the Amstaff and NiKo the American Bully. They have brought so much joy and love into my life, and I'm grateful for their constant companionship.

As I reflect on my life so far, I realize that I've been through a lot. I've faced challenges that would have broken others, but I've come out stronger and more resilient. And I've learned that life is full of surprises, both good and bad.

Turning 40 is just another chapter in my journey. I'm excited about what the future holds, and I'm committed to making a positive impact on the world. As a people leader in data science, I know that there's so much we can do to solve the world's biggest problems, and I'm excited to be a part of that.

At the end of the day, life is all about the journey. It's about the people we meet, the experiences we have, and the lessons we learn. I'm grateful for all the ups and downs that have brought me to this point, and I'm ready for whatever comes next.
