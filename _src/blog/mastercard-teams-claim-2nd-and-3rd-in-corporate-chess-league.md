**From Struggles to the Podium; From the Pawn to the Queens!**\

**The Journey of Building a Team That Works, Wins, and Smiles (all at the same time!)** 

A couple of years ago, I found myself saying yes to something unexpected—and it turned into one of the most rewarding journeys I’ve ever been a part of.

Back then, I met Ken, Brian, and Henry—fellow Mastercard colleagues I hadn’t even met in the office—who were looking to complete a four-person team for the St. Louis Chess Club’s **Corporate Chess League**. I showed up not knowing what to expect, but I left that first night having met three brilliant, kind people who would become great friends.

We played a few decent games that night, even picked up a couple of wins, but ultimately, we were outmatched and knocked out of the tournament. Our debut wasn’t exactly a Cinderella story—we were struggling, no doubt—but something clicked. A spark was lit, and we weren’t ready to let it fade.

Fast forward to *yesterday*, and I’m incredibly proud to say that our journey came full circle: **not one, but two Mastercard teams**—*Mastercard Red* and *Mastercard Orange*—finished **2nd and 3rd** respectively in the final standings of the 2024–25 Corporate Chess League!

And that’s not all—while our teams battled it out in the main tournament, we also had three players represent us in the Blitz side event. I even managed to grab **3rd place** myself… and the prize? A crisp **white hat**, which instantly became the *perfect trophy*—because I could throw it on my bald head right away. 😄 Practical, stylish, and symbolic!

It’s worth noting: both Mastercard teams are now so strong that none of us from the original four—except Ken, the steady champion among us—could even make the main lineup this year! (And yes, I say that with both pride *and* a little friendly envy.)

**So how did we get here?**

It didn’t happen overnight. Over the past two years, we slowly but surely built a chess community inside Mastercard. We found time in our busy schedules—meeting during lunch breaks, squeezing in games during quiet afternoons in the cafeteria. We started a weekly virtual session called **Friday Knights**, where we’d play, learn, and laugh together. We ran training and coaching sessions, cheered each other on, and grew stronger—*together*.

What began as a casual team turned into a culture. We even secured sponsorship for proper boards and professional chess clocks, which now live in the TechHub Fun Room (come by and play a game if you’re ever nearby!).

We built something truly special: a team that **works hard, wins games, and never forgets to smile along the way**.

I’ll always remember those early days—sharing strategies, recovering from blunders, and celebrating little wins that pushed us forward. Yesterday, standing beside this team of smart, humble, and passionate people, I felt nothing but pride.

### Final Standings – 2024–25 Corporate Chess League

1. **Washington University in St. Louis (Wash U)**
2. **Mastercard Red**
3. **Mastercard Orange**
4. **Enterprise**

More than ten corporate teams participated, and the competition was fierce. To come this far—and to do it *together*—is something I’ll always cherish.

Here’s to this incredible team and the joy of building something that proves it’s possible to **work, win, and smile**—all at the same time.

Until next season,♟️\
