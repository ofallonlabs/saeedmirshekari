If you are working in a medium to large team of Data Scientists in your organization, there is a high chance that they come from a vast variety of different backgrounds from different branches of Science and Engineering all the way to Math, Economics, Psychology and Linguistics! 

But, why? Why do Data Scientists have so many different backgrounds? And does that mean you can be a Data Scientist with your non-Data-Science background? 

The short answer is: diversity is powerful! Suppose you have a complex NLP project in your team. Which Data Scientist would you hire? A Data Scientist with a Linguistic background or without it?

Data scientists are known to be "unicorns". This is because of the broad range of skills they bring to the table, which is rarely found. The secret sauce is that coming from different backgrounds gives the Data Science teams diversity and the new perspectives which come with it.

Data Science requires a range of technical skills from various backgrounds to extract valuable insights from enormous data.

These skills and knowledge used in gleaning and processing Data stem from various study fields and backgrounds. 

Becoming a Data Scientist in 2022 generally requires a solid background in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. 

In this post, we will consider 

1. What Data Science really is,
2. The major fields involved in Data Science,
3. The main aspects of these fields involved in Data Science and,
4. How knowledge from each of these fields helps to solve real-world's problems. 

<h2>What is Data Science </h2>\
[Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#:~:text=Data%20science%20is%20an%20interdisciplinary,broad%20range%20of%20application%20domains.) is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured, and unstructured data. 

What fields are involved in Data Science? 

Data science is a multidisciplinary field of study that incorporates 

* Computer Science, 
* Math and Statistics, 
* Business and Communication. 

The task of gathering and interpreting big data sets, both structured and unstructured, falls into the purview of a data scientist. To make sense of big data and subsequently use the knowledge to develop business solutions, the data science profession combines knowledge and tools from these different fields. 

<h2>The 3 pillars of Data Science</h2>
<h3>1. Mathematics and Statistics</h3> 

A [Data Science career](https://saeedmirshekari.com/ecourse-bdsf/) needs Mathematics because it is necessary for machine learning algorithms, data analysis, and insight discovery. Math is a fundamental component of Machine Learning, and it assists in developing an algorithm that can learn from data and make precise predictions.

The Mathematics concepts used in Data Science include Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability Theory. Mathematics is applied in Data Science in the area of

* Natural Language Processing, 
* Computer Vision, 
* Marketing and Sales,
* And many more…

Although Math helps us understand ML algorithms, it is not sufficient to solve all the problems a Data Scientist encounters during a problem-solving journey. For example, Math doesn't provide us with the knowledge of coding which is needed for success in a Data Science Project.

In addition to basic Math, Probability and Statistics are also among the backbones of data science and data analysis. The knowledge of probability theory has been extremely helpful in making predictions. 

Statistics and Probability is used for the visualization of features, data preprocessing, feature transformation, data imputation, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, model evaluation, etc.

Some of the concepts of Statistics used in Data Science include Mean or Expectation Value, Variance and Standard Deviation, Confidence Interval, Central Limit Theorem, Correlation and Covariance, Probability Distribution, and Bayes’ Theorem.

<h3>2. Computer Programming</h3> 

Programming has been identified as the most important skill in Data Science. To refine the process of product development, improve customer retention, or mine data to find new business opportunities, a good combination of computation and analysis skills is needed. 

Programming is essential for all employment roles in the field of data science, especially in automating the cleaning and organization of unstructured data sets, creating databases, and optimizing machine learning algorithms. Programming plays great roles in many areas of Data Science including:

* Data Extraction
* Data Cleaning
* Data Visualization

As the field of data science develops, more and more programming languages are being created. Among the major languages are:

* Python
* R
* Julia
* Java
* C/C++

Python is the most popular programming language and it is recommended for beginners. Most of the activities in the data science domain happen around Python.

<h3>3. Business Acumen and Communication</h3>

Domain knowledge refers to knowledge about the environment in which the data is processed. Without sufficient domain knowledge, it will be impossible to fully activate the power of an algorithm because knowledge about the field where the data came from is unknown.

High level of expertise and knowledge about a particular field can highly improve the accuracy of an analysis. For any Data Scientist to successfully complete a DS project, sound domain knowledge is required.

Communication is also key in Data Science. Communication skills are just as vital as technical knowledge when it comes to data analysis, predictive modeling, and other tasks. Data Scientists must be able to clearly articulate their reasons for reaching a particular conclusion and support it with evidence. They must be able to persuade their audience that the results o﻿f their findings should be used and must also be able inspire their audience with examples of how doing so will benefit the company. That is an enormous amount of communication.

<h2>How do these fields combine?</h2>

To make sense of the enormous amount of Data available in the data-driven world today, a strong combination of analytical, computational, and experimental skills is needed.

By utilizing data to build algorithms and develop programs that aid in showing the best solutions to specific challenges, data science helps to solve real business problems. Statistics also explains the current condition of a corporate setting and predicts certain outcomes using the power of Data.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Data science requires a solid foundation in Maths, Statistics, Probability, and Computer Science—and certain habits of the mind like a positive attitude toward solving business issues and an attitude of empathy for customers. The combination of these several skills from various disciplines explains why Data Scientists are valued in the world of work. This unique combination of skills from different disciplines also reveals why becoming a Data Scientist could be difficult.
