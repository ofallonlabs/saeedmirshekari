## 90% of Leadership Is About Being Entertaining

**“Leadership is not just about vision—it’s also about attention. And attention, my friend, is earned through entertainment.”**

## Introduction

Leadership has long been framed as a mix of strategy, vision, and execution. We idolize the intellectual prowess of CEOs, the strategic acumen of generals, and the relentless drive of startup founders. But behind every great leader lies another, often unspoken trait: **the ability to entertain**.

Yes, entertain.

This isn’t to say leadership is a circus act or a stand-up routine, but rather that the modern leader must keep people *engaged*, *inspired*, and *emotionally hooked*. Whether leading a team of five or steering a multinational company, a large portion of effective leadership hinges on **how well you can hold people’s attention**.

Let’s explore this bold claim: **90% of leadership is about being entertaining.**

## Part I: Redefining “Entertaining”

Before we dive in, let’s clarify what “entertaining” really means.

* **It’s not about being funny** (though humor helps).
* **It’s not about constant performance** (though performance is part of it).
* **It’s not superficial charisma** (though charisma matters).

Being entertaining as a leader is about **creating emotional engagement**. It’s about being **interesting, relatable, unpredictable, and real**.

Great leaders:

* Tell compelling stories.
* Paint vivid pictures of the future.
* Infuse energy into meetings.
* Know when to drop a mic-worthy line.
* Use silence and presence as tools.
* Keep people guessing—and following.

### Entertainment = Engagement

In the age of shrinking attention spans, the best leaders don't just **inform**; they **inspire**. They don’t just **direct**; they **draw people in**. And the secret weapon? Entertainment.

## Part II: Why Entertainment Matters in Leadership

### 1. **People Are Emotion-Driven**

Humans make decisions emotionally and justify them logically. A spreadsheet doesn’t spark loyalty. A speech does. A Gantt chart doesn’t make people stay late. A rallying cry does.

People follow those who make them *feel something*. If your team is emotionally invested, they’ll move mountains. If they’re bored or disconnected, they’ll ghost you in a heartbeat.

### 2. **Storytelling Beats Strategy Every Time**

What do Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and Elon Musk have in common? Not just their accomplishments—but their ability to **sell a story**.

* “I have a dream.”
* “We’re putting 1,000 songs in your pocket.”
* “We’re going to colonize Mars.”

These aren’t just statements. They’re entertainment in its highest form: **vision told as story**.

If you want your team to follow your roadmap, don’t just show them the steps—**make them feel the destination**.

### 3. **The War for Attention Is Real**

We’re living in a world of nonstop distraction: emails, meetings, Slack, TikTok, 3-minute videos. You’re not just competing with other leaders—you’re competing with **cat videos and Instagram reels**.

If your team zones out during every meeting, you’ve already lost. The leader who can break through the noise and **capture attention** wins.

## Part III: The Entertainment Toolkit for Leaders

So how does a leader become entertaining without becoming a clown?

Here’s your toolkit:

### 1. **Master the Art of Storytelling**

Humans are wired for stories. Turn data into a journey. Turn updates into sagas.

* Instead of: *“Sales are up 7%.”*
* Try: *“Remember when we thought that new client would ghost us after the second call? They just signed a multi-year deal and made this quarter our best yet.”*

Make your message memorable.

### 2. **Play with Rhythm and Energy**

A monotone voice and bullet points kill momentum. Change your tone, speed, and volume. Drop your voice to make a point. Pause dramatically. Speed up when you’re excited.

Even if your message is dry, your delivery doesn’t have to be.

### 3. **Use Humor Intentionally**

You don’t have to be a stand-up comic, but a well-timed joke or ironic observation goes a long way. Humor lowers defenses and creates connection.

And self-deprecating humor? Gold.

### 4. **Design Your Presence**

Your walk, your wardrobe, your body language—it’s all part of the show. You don’t have to be flashy, but you should be intentional.

People read your face before they hear your words. Are you alive? Are you present? Are you real?

### 5. **Create Moments, Not Meetings**

No one remembers “weekly sync #204.”

They remember:

* The surprise guest speaker.
* The bold challenge you dropped.
* The emotional story you told.

Design *moments* that make people lean in.

## Part IV: But… What About Competence?

You might be thinking: *Isn’t this just fluff?*

Let’s be clear: **competence is table stakes**. You need to be good at your job. You need a vision. You need to make sound decisions.

But once you’re competent, your ability to **lead** is measured by your ability to **inspire**, **engage**, and **rally people**.

And that, my friend, is 90% entertainment.

Imagine two equally competent leaders. One is magnetic, the other is forgettable. Who do people follow? Who builds a loyal team? Who gets promoted?

Exactly.

## Part V: Real-World Examples

### 1. **Barack Obama**

No matter your politics, Obama knew how to **hold a room**. He used rhythm, pauses, humor, and narrative to turn even dry topics into compelling stories.

He wasn’t just informing—he was entertaining. And people followed.

### 2. **Elon Musk**

Is he controversial? Yes. Is he awkward? Often. But he’s never boring.

From meme-worthy tweets to product unveilings that feel like rock concerts, Musk keeps the world’s eyes on him—and his companies.

### 3. **Brené Brown**

She talks about vulnerability, shame, and leadership—a combo that sounds like it belongs in therapy, not TED.

And yet, she’s wildly successful because she **makes it engaging**. Her use of personal stories, humor, and realness turns complexity into connection.

### 4. **Richard Branson**

Branson once dressed up as a flight attendant for a lost bet. He kite-surfs, tells wild stories, and doesn’t take himself too seriously. Is he smart? Yes. But he's also *fun*. His brand = entertainment.

## Part VI: Entertainment in Daily Leadership

### Running a Team Meeting

* Start with a surprising story or stat.
* Use visuals, metaphors, or analogies.
* End with a memorable quote or challenge.

### Giving Feedback

* Sandwich dry feedback with humor and warmth.
* Use examples they can relate to.
* Make the conversation human, not robotic.

### Inspiring Your Team

* Don’t just say “do your best”—tell them why it matters.
* Use real stories from the trenches.
* Make it *feel* like a mission, not a task list.

## Part VII: The Risks (and How to Avoid Them)

Entertainment in leadership isn’t about faking it or becoming a caricature.

Here’s what to **watch out for**:

### 1. **Style Without Substance**

Don’t become a “leader-influencer” who’s all flash and no depth. Always back up your storytelling with results.

### 2. **Performing Instead of Leading**

People can sniff out inauthenticity. Don’t be a performer—be a **leader who knows how to perform** when needed.

### 3. **Overusing the Spotlight**

Don’t always make it about you. Entertain to elevate others. Let team members shine. Be the host, not the star.

## Part VIII: You’re Already Doing It

If you’ve ever:

* Told a story to motivate a friend…
* Made a joke to ease tension in a group…
* Gotten someone excited about an idea…

…you’ve used entertainment as a leadership tool.

Now, the invitation is to do it more **intentionally**.

## Conclusion: Leadership Is Theater (Kind Of)

The workplace is a stage. Every meeting, every presentation, every 1-on-1 is a scene.

You can mumble your lines and hope they land.

Or you can own the role.

The most effective leaders today are not the most analytical, most technical, or even the most visionary. They’re the ones who can **capture attention, connect emotionally, and keep people coming back**.

In a noisy world, being entertaining is not optional—it’s essential.

So the next time you walk into a room, ask yourself:

> **Am I here to manage, or am I here to move people?**

If it’s the latter, lean into your inner entertainer. You don’t have to juggle or dance—you just have to connect.

And if you do it well?

They’ll follow you not because they *have to*, but because they *want to*.

## TL;DR

* Leadership is 90% about engaging people emotionally.
* Being “entertaining” means being interesting, memorable, and real—not fake or flashy.
* Storytelling, humor, presence, and rhythm are essential leadership tools.
* Competence gets you in the room; charisma keeps you there.
* Today’s leaders must compete for attention, and that means mastering the art of connection.
