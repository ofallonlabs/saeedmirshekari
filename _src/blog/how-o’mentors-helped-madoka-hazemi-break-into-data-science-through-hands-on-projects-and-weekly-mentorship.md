## 🌟 Voices of O’Mentors: From Learning by Doing to Consulting in Life Sciences

At **O’Mentors**, we believe the best way to learn data science is through action—not just theory. In today’s spotlight, we share the journey of [**Madoka Hazemi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madoka-hazemi-98056350/), who turned her curiosity into practical skill with the help of hands-on mentorship. This post is based on her direct reflections after working with **Dr. Saeed Mirshekari**, founder of O’Mentors.

### ✅ What were you looking for?

> “I was looking for a mentor who could give me a clear, hands-on path into data science.”

Madoka was ready to enter the world of data science, but she wanted more than abstract advice or self-paced courses. She needed structure, guidance, and someone who could translate her interest into tangible experience—fast.

### 💡 How did the mentorship help?

> “We kicked off by immediately doing a project in a topic I like, exactly what I needed since I learn best by doing.”

Rather than beginning with lectures or lengthy theory, her mentorship started with *action*. Together with Dr. Saeed, she launched into a real project in a domain she cared about, reinforcing the principle that the best way to learn is by solving problems.

* **Weekly Deep Dives**:

  > “Weekly sessions with Saeed broke down the techniques required for each problem and really deepened my understanding of the core principles of data science.”

  Through regular sessions, Saeed helped Madoka dissect each challenge and build mastery—step by step. These discussions emphasized the “why” behind each method, not just the “how,” giving her a strong foundation to grow from.

### 🚀 Where are you now?

> “I'm currently a consultant at Kx Advisors (DC) and still applying some data science skills I learned from O'Mentors to solve life science problems!”

Today, Madoka is working at **Kx Advisors**, a strategic consultancy based in Washington, DC. In her role, she applies the exact skills she honed during her mentorship to tackle complex problems in the life sciences domain.

Her transition is a great example of how a targeted mentorship—combined with action and curiosity—can lead to real career impact.

### 🗣️ Would you recommend O’Mentors?

> “If you want a mentor who's deeply knowledgeable but patient, practical, and pushes you to apply what you learn, O’Mentors is the best investment you’ll make!”

At O’Mentors, we match curious learners with industry mentors who care deeply, teach patiently, and push you to grow through *real* experience—not just theory.
