<h2> Why Data Science Mentoring? </h2>

Mentoring is a great way to help others succeed. But it's also a way to help yourself improve as a mentor and grow your network of contacts.

<h2> The Best Way To Manage 1-on-1 Mentoring Meetings </h2>

Mentors and mentees should have a clear idea of what they want out of the relationship, including how many meetings they can commit to, any travel or holiday plans during the mentoring period, what they'd like to get out of the relationship and set goals, and when they'll meet next.

Then they should establish the relationship by reviewing any action items from previous meetings and discussing specific career goals and asking your mentee to share their Development Card with you. They should also suggest that your mentee use an action planning log.

Subsequent meetings should be used for understanding development needs, sharing knowledge, and agreeing on deliverables. When appropriate, introduce your mentee to relevant networks or groups; candidly share personal assumptions and limitations; wrap up with finalizing action items and review goals; keep in touch with each other after ending your relationship (if applicable).
