## 🌟 Voices of O’Mentors: How Bahareh Landed a Data Scientist Role at Johnson & Johnson in Just One Month

At **O'Mentors**, we believe that personalized mentorship can unlock opportunities that might otherwise feel out of reach. Each journey is unique—and some are truly inspiring. This post is part of our **Voices of O’Mentors** series, highlighting real stories from our mentees, in their own words.

Today, we’re sharing the story of **[Bahareh Kilcoyne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bahareh-kilcoyne-bb88b0160/)**, a driven data science professional who found new momentum in her job search after working with O’Mentors—and landed a role at one of the world’s top healthcare companies in just a month.

### ✅ What were you looking for?

> “I was searching for a senior data science position for months…”

Bahareh came to O’Mentors during a frustrating and uncertain period. Despite her qualifications and experience, her job applications weren’t yielding results. Like many job seekers in today’s competitive data science market, she found herself stuck in a cycle of sending resumes and hearing nothing back.

She knew she had the skills—but something in her approach needed to change. That’s when she discovered O’Mentors and decided to schedule a session with **Dr. Saeed Mirshekari**, founder of the platform and a data science leader with years of industry experience.

### 💡 How did the mentorship help?

> “The mentoring program was extremely helpful to refine my resume, highlight my achievements more than going down to minor technical details.”

In her mentorship session, Bahareh received targeted and strategic feedback focused on what hiring managers in senior data science roles are truly looking for.

* **Resume Repositioning**:
  Bahareh’s original resume leaned too heavily into technical minutiae. Saeed guided her to shift the emphasis toward business impact, leadership, and measurable results—highlighting her *achievements* rather than just her *responsibilities*. This seemingly small change made a major difference in how her application was perceived.

* **Mock Interview Practice**:

  > “Mock interview was extremely beneficial as Saeed commented on my deliveries and how I can improve the scenarios to make them more relatable to the role.”

  During mock interviews, Saeed helped Bahareh polish her communication style, align her stories with the expectations of senior roles, and tailor her responses for behavioral and technical interview questions. These sessions built her confidence and helped her present herself as a clear, strategic thinker with strong business value.

In her words, these insights were “extremely beneficial”—and they paid off quickly.

### 🚀 Where are you now?

> “After mentoring session with Saeed and applying his suggestion to my resume and mock interviews, I secured a position in a matter of a month.”

Bahareh is now an **R\&D Quality Data Scientist at Janssen**, a **Johnson & Johnson** company, based in **New Hampshire**. She works at the intersection of data science, healthcare innovation, and quality assurance—playing a critical role in advancing medical research and improving patient outcomes.

Her story is proof that small strategic changes—guided by someone who’s been there—can lead to big outcomes in your job search.
