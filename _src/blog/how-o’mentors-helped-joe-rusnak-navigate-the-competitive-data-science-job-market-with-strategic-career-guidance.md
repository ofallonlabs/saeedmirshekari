## 🌟 Voices of O’Mentors: Strategic Career Guidance from a Mentor Who Gets It

At **O’Mentors**, we’re proud to be more than just a platform for advice—we’re a community built on real conversations, lived experience, and deep, personal mentorship. In this installment of our *Voices of O’Mentors* series, we’re spotlighting a testimonial from [**Dr. Joe Rusnak**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-joseph-rusnak-ph-d-17a237238/), a Ph.D.-level professional navigating the highly competitive world of data science.

This post is based on Joe’s own words and reflections, shared after his mentorship experience with **Dr. Saeed Mirshekari**, founder of O’Mentors.

### ✅ What were you looking for?

Like many professionals entering or advancing in data science, Joe understood the paradox of the industry:

> “Despite high demand for data scientists, landing top-tier roles remains surprisingly challenging.”

He was looking for clarity—guidance that didn’t just rehash generic advice but instead acknowledged the nuances of the market and the unspoken rules of elite hiring in tech and analytics. He needed insight from someone who’s not only technically fluent, but who truly understands how hiring decisions get made.

### 💡 How did the mentorship help?

> “Saeed leverages his Ph.D.-level expertise to provide career guidance that cuts through the noise of a competitive data science job market.”

Joe’s experience with Saeed wasn’t just about polishing resumes or practicing interviews—it was about strategy and self-awareness. What stood out to him was how Saeed helped break down what *really* matters to employers, beyond buzzwords and code proficiency:

* **Authentic Positioning**:

  > “What makes Saeed exceptional is his ability to help aspiring data scientists position themselves authentically…”

  Saeed worked with Joe to align his messaging with his personal strengths, goals, and voice—so that he wasn’t just chasing jobs, but presenting himself as a strategic asset to the right employers.

* **Business-Relevant Skills**:

  > “…understanding what employers truly value beyond technical skills—from storytelling with data to stakeholder communication to strategic thinking that drives business impact.”

  In a crowded market, technical skills alone aren't enough. Saeed helped Joe emphasize the higher-order skills that define senior data professionals: narrative, influence, and business fluency.

### 🚀 Where are you now?

While this testimonial doesn't mention a specific job outcome, Joe’s words reflect a renewed confidence and strategic clarity in his career direction. He has added Saeed to his professional circle and values his continued mentorship.

> “I am glad to have Saeed in my professional circle.”

Whether you're just starting out or already hold a Ph.D., finding someone who *gets* both the technical and business sides of data science can be game-changing. For Joe, Saeed became that trusted advisor.

### 🗣️ Would you recommend O’Mentors?

> “Saeed leverages his expertise... What makes him exceptional… I am glad to have him in my professional circle.”
