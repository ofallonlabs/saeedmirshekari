There is a silence that wraps around memory like the soft closing of an old wooden door, the kind you don’t notice until the echo fades and you’re left standing there, still, in the in-between—between the life you left behind and the one you’ve been trying, piece by fragile piece, to build again in a place that never knew your name.

I was born into a life of rhythm and warmth, in a home where the past breathed through photographs on the wall, where elders spoke of lineage like it was gold passed hand to hand, where the path ahead was paved not in guesswork but in continuity—a life not just of people and places, but of certainty, of recognition, of being held in a space where I already belonged before I ever achieved anything at all.

In Iran, I was not a stranger to identity; I was its extension.

My family’s roots ran deep in the city like the shadow of a pomegranate tree stretching long into dusk, and my own life unfolded in the quiet confidence that comes from knowing who you are, where you stand, and why. I studied physics not to escape anything, but because the mysteries of the world whispered their riddles to me and I, like a faithful student, answered back with equations, questions, and late-night wonder. There was ambition, yes, but it sat comfortably beside tradition, because I had a place at the table, a name in the family, and a future that, if not easy, was at least visible.

But time, as it does, moved forward, and I with it—not away from my homeland, not at first, but outward, expanding, exploring, convinced that one could stretch without tearing, that one could go far and still be held by invisible strings of home.

And for a while, it was true.

Brazil offered a detour, a postdoctoral adventure, a time of curiosity and challenge, but it was not yet the second life—it was still a chapter in the first, a foreign paragraph written in the same language of purpose.

But when I returned to the United States—not as a student, not as a scholar, but as a dependent, as someone who legally could not work, could not earn, could not even contribute—I stepped not into the next phase of the journey, but into a void.

It is a strange thing, to be stripped of your ability to act.

To be fully formed—educated, willing, fluent in ideas—and yet invisible to the system you find yourself in. My degrees did not matter. My skills went uncalled. The world around me pulsed with motion, and I sat still in the middle of it, like a forgotten statue in a crowded plaza.

And back home, life continued.

Relatives gathered for weddings I couldn’t attend. Friends moved on. Elders aged. The calendar turned, and my absence became a fact of life, not a wound to be worried about. The culture I knew so intimately began to erode from my tongue; the customs I had carried like second skin started to feel like distant stories. It was then I realized: I was no longer living the first life, but I had not yet arrived in the second.

There is a moment—quiet, undramatic—when you understand you must start again.

Mine came in a small office in St. Louis, Missouri, where I took a role at Aclara. It wasn’t a job that matched my past, but it was a door, and after so long in stillness, even the smallest door feels like salvation. I worked not to climb, but to breathe. To be seen. To prove that I still existed.

But life has a way of reshaping you not just through the obstacles you expect, but the ones that arrive like lightning—sudden, blinding, irreversible.

Just as I returned to the United States, clinging to hope and rebuilding my path one uncertain step at a time, the ground gave way beneath me in a way I could never have imagined. I was blindsided by divorce—an ending I didn’t see coming, and one that left me shattered in a place already unfamiliar, with no family nearby, no support system to catch me, and no script for what to do next.

Grief in a foreign land is a strange and quiet ache. There is no ritual, no village of elders, no familiar voices at your door. Only silence. The kind that fills your apartment at night when even the hum of the fridge feels like a reminder that you are now alone.

I thought I had already lost enough. I had left my country, my identity, my language, my career. But this—this was the loss of companionship, of partnership, of the imagined future I had wrapped around someone else's presence. That kind of loss rewires your soul.

And yet, slowly, over months of walking through fog, I did what we humans have always done when our lives collapse.

I began again.

First in small, almost invisible ways. I showed up to work. I said yes to coffee invites. I listened to music in the car. I found reasons to stay upright.

Then, something miraculous happened: life offered me love again.

Not the kind you force or chase, but the kind that arrives like a beam of sunlight on a winter afternoon—unexpected, warm, undeniable. A year after the darkest time in my personal life, I married again—this time, not just to heal, but to build. I married the love of my life, not to replace what was lost, but to grow something entirely new. Something rooted not in naïve certainty, but in mature, hard-earned hope.

And that moment changed me again—this time not through pain, but through peace.

At Bayer, I found myself closer to innovation, engaging with real problems in agriculture, healthcare, and technology. Then, at The Climate Corporation, I moved deeper into machine learning and data science, where my work began to ripple outward—helping farmers make better decisions, helping teams find patterns in chaos. For the first time in years, I was not just surviving—I was building again. Not rebuilding. That word implies you get to start with pieces from before. No—this was from scratch.

Life Two is not a sequel. It is a rebirth.

Every conversation, every project, every meeting required translation—not of language, but of self. I had to render who I was into a format that could be understood, accepted, and eventually respected. It was work, but not just professional work—it was soul work. I was becoming a new version of myself, and each job was a paragraph in that becoming.

At Mastercard, where I now serve as Director of Data Science, I lead with both precision and memory—with models, yes, and with metrics, but also with the quiet confidence of someone who has walked through the fire and made it to the other side without burning bitter. My work matters—impacting global commerce, guiding product strategy, solving real business problems with real mathematical elegance—but so does the story behind it. Because I didn’t just arrive here. I built the road, brick by invisible brick.

And somewhere along that road, I realized I wasn’t alone.

There were others—immigrants, dreamers, displaced scientists, eager learners—who were living in the silence between two lives, just as I had. And that’s why I founded *O’Mentors*—not just a platform to connect mentees with data science mentors, but a space carved out of empathy, experience, and hope.

Because I know now what I didn’t know then: that life can be restarted, that careers can be rebuilt, and that sometimes the most powerful guidance doesn’t come from a textbook or a tutorial but from a person who has lived through it and is still standing.

If my first life was a gift—granted by family, culture, and place—then my second life was a work of art, carved from loss, learning, and relentless construction. The two lives don’t compete. They coexist. One gave me roots. The other gave me wings.

And now, I live with both inside me.
