Startups with significant funding (e.g., unicorns) pay handsomely to attract talent, often with a mix of base and equity.

###  3\. Talent Competition 

Companies competing for top-tier talent drive salaries up. Highly visible companies tend to have strong employer branding and aggressive compensation.

###  4\. Role Complexity and Impact 

Positions requiring cutting-edge ML research or mission-critical production systems often pay more.

###  5\. Location
