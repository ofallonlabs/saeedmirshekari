<b>Welcome, Neighbor. </b> 

<div>


<p>If you’re here, you’ve heard it too.  </p>

<p>The engines roar, the windows shake,  
The peace we had, now theirs to take.  </p>

<p>This poem isn’t just words on a page—it’s the reality we live every day.  
The constant noise, the reckless behavior, and the silence of those who should help.  </p>

<p>So read on, and know you’re not alone.  </p>

<p>— A Concerned Neighbor  </p>
</div>

<b>The Roar of the Ride (And the Neighborhood That Doesn't Care) </b>

<p>Each morning and night, without fail,  
A thunderous roar tears through the veil.  
<p>The car so fierce, the engine loud,  
Revving high, disturbingly proud.  
<p>***
  
<p>Its engine growls, its tires screech,  
Peace and quiet—out of reach.  
<p>Walls begin to shake,  
Dreams jolt awake.  
<p>***
  
<p>But this ride is not alone, you see,  
Another joins this loud symphony.  
<p>A gold LeSabre, years gone by,  
Blasting past like it’s alive.  
<p>***
  
<p>One night, without a word or care,  
It pulled in a driveway, unaware.  
<p>But wait—it wasn’t by mistake,  
They knew exactly what they’d make.  
<p>Intentional, the noise they’d bring,  
Blasting sound with reckless sting.  
<p>***
  
<p>And if the engines weren’t enough,  
Fireworks came, loud and rough.  
<p>Dropped so close, the lawns ablaze,  
Echoing through sleepless days.  
<p>***
  
<p>Through all this noise, those nearby stay,  
Silent, still—they look away.  
<p>One might say, with steady breath,  
“I don’t let it bother me” to death.  
<p>But maybe fear’s the real refrain,  
Scared as hell, yet they remain.  
<p>***
  
<p>Then came a group, a rowdy crew,  
Dressed in uniforms, crisp and new.  
<p>They made their way to bang on doors,  
And run away, causing uproar.  
<p>***
  
<p>Garage doors shook, their hands hit hard,  
A reckless thrill in the quiet yard.  
<p>Lies dripped down, straight to our face,  
“I don’t know who, it wasn’t them,”  
But checks were cut, leaving guilt in place.  
<p>***
  
<p>Then another house, a tale untold,  
Engines roaring, peace set to fold.  
<p>Neighbors asked, they spoke with care,  
Only to get a spiteful glare.  
<p>Each complaint, they take as war,  
Talking back, defending more.  
<p>***
  
<p>And if the mess could end right there,  
Another sight still fills the air.  
<p>A wooden pallet, left for months,  
Soaked by rain, just standing once.  
<p>It might be gone, no longer there,  
But if you look, it’s still somewhere.  
<p>Ugly, broken, left to decay,  
A piece of trash that’s in the way.  
<p>***
  
<p>Through all of this, authorities seem weak,  
The noise still reigns, the silence bleak.  
<p>A year and a half, still the same,  
Yet action hides behind the blame.  
<p>An officer sat at a meeting’s grace,  
Not to fix or enforce the case,  
<p>But scowl at victims, worse and worse.  
We wish he had results to disperse.  
<p>***

<p>And what of the board, who ought to care?  
Useless, blind, they leave us there.  
<p>They give their praise, their credit due,  
To a place of lies untrue.  
<p>A toxic site, a hateful page,  
Run by one long out of the stage.  
<p>No longer here, yet still in power,  
As rumors spread and neighbors sour.  
<p>***

<p>Through months and months, the pattern stays,  
Shattering nights, disrupting days.  
<p>Is there an end? A hope? A chance?  
Or just more noise, a tireless dance?  
<p>***

<p>But justice waits with measured pace,  
Noise complaints soon take their place.  
<p>May silence one day find its way,  
And let the restless sleep and stay.  
<p>***

<b>You Heard It Too? Let’s Speak Up.  </b>

<p>This isn’t just my frustration—it’s a community issue.  
If you care about peace and respect in our neighborhood, let’s make our voices heard.  

<p>📌 Report Noise Complaints to Authorities  
<p>📌 Hold HOA Accountable  
<p>📌 Respect Your Neighbors  

<p>*Note: All names, video footage, and details are recorded and held privately in case it becomes necessary to share publicly.*  

<p>Maybe, together, we can bring back the quiet.
