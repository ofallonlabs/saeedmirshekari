          <h1>ACADEMIA</h1>
          <p>During my academic career (2005-2015) I was focused on Theoretical Physics, namely, Gravitation and Astrophysics. In particular, my interests are in mathematical aspects of Einstein's Theory of Relativity and testing its predictions mainly about Gravitational Waves. Below you can learn more about my research topics and why I found them interesting.</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Black Holes & General Relativity</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Did you know that if we wouldn't carefully consider the calculations from Einstein's Theory of Relativity in our GPS devices (for example your car navigation system or your Apple watch's) they completely lose their accuracy in less than 2 minutes?! 
            </p>
            <p>
              Einstein's Theory of Relativity (1915) is still the best theory we have in place to explain the dynamics of the Universe around us specially when we study super massive celestial objects in high speeds (such as Neutron Stars and Black Holes orbiting around each other!). However, some aspects of this theory are still unknown or needs to be studied, tested, and adjusted!
            </p>
            <p>
              During my Master and PhD I researched some of these research topics and published the results.

            <h3>Data Analysis of Gravitational Waves</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Did you know that if a major celestial event (for example collision of two massive galaxies) has had happened very far away (for example billions of light years away, meaning it would take billions of years for light to reach that far!) we are able to detect it today right here on Earth?!
            </p>
            <p>
              Gravitational Waves have been one of the most mysterious predictions of Einstein's Theory of Relativity (1915). Beside the weak nature of gravity, and because the common sources of gravitational waves are very far away, they are extremely weak and therefore hard to detect from Earth. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2015, a team of 1000+ scientists [<a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">LIGO</a>] could successfully detect Gravitational Waves directly in the United States for the very first time ever and I was fortunate to be part of the team. My contribution was helping with analyzing recorded data and testing numerical methods to estimate the source parameters such as mass, spin, and velocity.

          <h1>INDUSTRY</h1>
          <p>Given my skills and background in advanced statistics, complex problem solving, and data-analysis tools & techniques plus my passion to work more closely with people and make bigger impacts on their lives, I made a transition to industry in 2015. Since then I have been focused on the Applications of Data Science and Machine Learning on various business sectors:</p>

            <h3>Smart Grid & Utility Networks</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Did you know that he annual cost of power outages can cost the US economy over $150 billion dollars?! And until very recently most of the utility companies had little or no way to monitor/predict outages in their network.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using different Machine Learning algorithms, I built and evaluated predictive models for residential electricity consumption based on historical data in combination with auxiliary forecast weather data. In separate projects, I developed web-based apps to analyze electric distribution networks and anomaly detection via clustering algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had a major role in the development of the organization's Fault Detection and Localization's core algorithm (Bayesian Network & Information Theory) and all its data analysis [US-Patent #10401402].

            <h3>Modern Agriculture & Plant Breeding</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              Did you know that the average performance of corn farms in the US has jumped 600% from 25 bu/ac in 1935 to 150 bu/ac in 2010 due to continuous advanced plant breeding programs?! 
            </p>
            <p>
              In recent years Data Science also has made a big impact on modern agriculture to keep increasing the genetic gain and crop yields. It also helps providing better recommendations on farm management decisions during the growing season.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through leading several Data Science projects on analyzing plant breeding data (Genotype and Phenotype data) from labs and trial fields on one side and millions of acres of commercial grain farms on another side, I helped to bring value and bridge from large scale research data to the commercial side. I had the opportunity to successfully lead a small team of data scientist interns through technical projects.

            <p class="fst-italic">
              Did you know that healthcare fraud costs the nation about $200 billion annually in the US?! This is roughly about 10% of the total healthcare spending each year!!
            </p>
            <p>
              Data Science and Machine Learning algorithms can help with detecting and preventing the fraudulent activities. Although frauds are always evolving from one type to another and we still have a long way ahead but great advancement has been already made in this area by implementing AI solutions into the complex US healthcare system.
            </p>
            <p>
              I helped one of the major health insurance providers in the nation to fight Fraud, Waste, and Abuse by analyzing insurance claim data and build Supervised and Unsupervised Learning to detect and prevent fraud in medical insurance claims.

            </p>
            <p>
              Banks and financial institutes can save millions of dollars annually by using AI solutions to predict the potential delinquent customers and take actions before that happens.
            </p>
            <p>
              I helped several national and international banks and financials institutes by analyzing their data and then building and evaluating custom credit-risk models for them by which they could save millions of dollars annually.
