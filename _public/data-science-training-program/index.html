                      It does seem crazy to me!
                      A few weeks ago, I possessed little knowledge of Machine Learning and now after this week, I am able to deploy a model. I would never have even created a GitHub account for a few months thinking I don't have enough knowledge but this course made me do so. There's still a lot to learn but this course has made me do things which I otherwise would have been too scared to do. I'm grateful for that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I consider myself lucky to have come across this course. It has provided a complete framework to become a data scientist. A few weeks ago, I was sort of intimidated by all the tools and technologies I needed to learn and I was not sure which one to learn first and where exactly it will be required. But this course has put everything into perspective and I’m not afraid anymore. I’ll be indebted to you for giving me this opportunity and I sincerely thank you for being so approachable and kind to clarify all the doubts I had.

                      I found this course as a great introduction to data science. Coming into it I had little to no experience regarding data science and machine learning models etc. I am a CS student so I was aware of what these things were but what was so great about this course was that it forced me to actually get things done and it gave us a complete view and understanding of how a data scientist works. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      It is by no means a deep dive into each and everything a data scientist does but it gives us a complete end to end picture of things we will be working on and how we will do it. Plus its a course which encourages self-study and leave a lot up to the students to learn and implement which I think is a great way to promote self-learning as there is absolutely no way each and everything can be spoon fed to students.

                      This course helped me putting all the pieces together and gave me a clear picture of the DS dynamics. Before taking this course, I was studying some parts by myself but they felt somehow disconnected. Thanks to course I am now able to put all the pieces together in a coherent picture.

                      This overview of tools, methods and steps is very useful for me! I encountered various names of tools and methods in the past and I got somehow confused and a bit "intimidated" because I did not have the big picture. Very useful. Thanks Saeed!

                      I was looking for a career outside Academia, and Data Science interested me. When I started reading about it online, I was bombarded with too much information about tools and technologies in Data Science and I felt overwhelmed with all that. I came across this course just at the right time and it delivered what it promised, a complete overview of the entire life cycle of Data Science. My confusion and fear were sorted out by this course and I now have that sketch in my mind which I need to refine.</p>

                      <p>Another reason to participate in this course was to explore the field of Machine Learning quickly because although I made a decision to switch to Data Science, I was not sure whether I would actually like it or not. Again, with the hands-on experience I achieved in past few weeks, I enjoyed what I was doing and I am assured of the fact that I would not regret my decision. Thank you for giving me the confidence I needed to continue.

                      I strongly recommend this online course. It gave me an absolutely amazing overview on the entire process. Before taking the course, my idea about the data science was limited to knowing how to code. This course gave me a bigger picture and the knowledge about the whole process.

                The Learning course spans over 5 weeks and 14 separate modules. Our focus with this course is to provide in-depth starting education on the Data Science industry. Each week will be focused on a particular topic with a specific practical goal.
              </p>
              <p>
                The materials offered to you will come in three types:
