<p>The US soil is what people call “The American Dream”. People from all over the world come to pursue their dreams in the United States. At <a href="https://saeedmirshekari.com/">O’Fallon Labs</a>, many of our international clients come to the US with the dream of getting the best data science job.</p>
<p>But conquering a new world is always challenging. With education and work experience outside of the US, getting hired as a data scientist can be difficult, especially when you don’t know where to start.</p>
<p>So, if you’re passionate about Data Science but scared of all the “ifs, buts, and whats”, you are in the right spot. Here are our recommendations for what you need to do:</p>
<h2>Tips to Get Your First Data Science Job in the US</h2>
<h3>1. Calm Your Nerves and Start Today</h3>
<p>Again, we know how hard and overwhelming it can be to find a job in a new country. The cultural difference and overall environmental change can be daunting enough for newbies to regress into their shells.</p>
<p>But that’s where everything will go wrong. Remember, you don’t have time to waste. To start your career in data science from scratch, you must take action from the very first day. This means calming down your nerves and taking action from the very first day - which brings us to our next point...</p>
<h3>2. Research the Job Market</h3>
<p>Your intro to the data science field won’t happen by a miracle. You will have to work for it. The US job market is very diverse and competitive. Wasting a single day or procrastinating will not benefit your career development.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the hiring process is tedious and takes time. So, there is NO time to waste. Start learning about the data analytics job market and make a flowchart of steps you’ll have to take to score your first data science job.</p>
<p>This physical mindmap will make it easier for you to stick to your daily goals. Moreover, don’t waste time searching for meaningless details. One of the best ways to research the job market is by taking help from others.</p>
<p>When you feel stuck, there’s nothing wrong with asking for help (preferably from a mentor). Your prior practical experience matters a lot, but it would go unnoticed if you don’t know how the job market and where to sell your experience.</p>
<h3>3. Learn About Possibilities</h3>
<p>Possibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building your network</li>
<li>Joining data science communities (forums and groups)</li>
<li>Talking to like-minded people</li>
<li>Attending local data science events</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides, you can explore YouTube (and similar resources online) and watch pre-recorded lectures from experts in the field. Learning about new possibilities will keep you focused and away from distractions. It’ll also expose you to the dynamics of your new environment. Keep your focus on building yourself into the expert the market needs.</p>
<h3>4. Adapt to the New Job Market</h3>
<p>Match your prior experienced self to the one required in the job market. Different data science roles require different skill sets and experience. The new job market may be different from where you previously were. So, compare your skill set to the one required by DS jobs.</p>
<p>If you find any gaps, instead of panicking, work on closing those gaps. Keep yourself open to change. A diverse skillset will prepare you for all kinds of data science jobs. Understand the differences between where you are and where you want to be.</p>
<p>Then think about the practical steps you’ll take to get there. Remember, change is compulsory. So, adopt!</p>
<h3>5. Take Practical Actions</h3>
<p>All your research will be useless if you don’t take practical steps. As soon as you identify the strengths and weaknesses of your skillset, use all available resources to improve it and gain more experience.</p>
<p>Take online bootcamps, check out the best data science courses online, read textbooks, and update your resume. Get your resume reviewed by a <a href="https://saeedmirshekari.com/blog/2022-08-15-why-you-need-a-data-science-career-mentor/">mentor</a>. However, be mindful of the time and money you spend on all these things.</p>
<p>Some bootcamps can be as costly as $30,000 with more than six months of classes without any job guarantee. In contrast, hiring a qualified mentor will cost you less time and money and guarantee better results. Whichever option you choose, do it carefully!</p>
<h3>6. Hire a Mentor</h3>
<p>It’s always best to talk to somebody who has already been through all these steps and succeeded. Don’t think you can conquer the world alone. It’s better to make an impact with the help of a <a href="https://saeedmirshekari.com/results/">qualified mentor</a> than to run alone in the dark.</p>
<p>Mentors like <a href="https://saeedmirshekari.com/team/">Saeed MirShekari</a> will guide you in the right direction. These individuals know how vast the <a href="https://saeedmirshekari.com/blog/2022-05-19-the-talent-gap-in-data-science-today-and-tomorrow/">talent gap</a> in the data science field is. And how <a href="https://saeedmirshekari.com/blog/2022-05-23-data-science-opportunities-and-immigrants-with-higher-educations/">immigrants</a> can take advantage of this talent gap.</p>
<p>Check out our data analytics for beginners course <a href="https://saeedmirshekari.com/ecourse-bdsf/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finding a source of income in a new country can be intimidating and overwhelming. This doesn’t mean that you can’t get your dream job. You just have to prepare yourself and search for it the right way. And the best way is by connecting to a data science professional.</p>
<p>A qualified mentor can simplify the steps of getting a job for you. Data science is an <a href="https://saeedmirshekari.com/blog/2022-07-15-top-10-most-in-demand-skills-for-data-scientists-in-2022/">in-demand skill</a>. So, only seek jobs after researching the job market. Don’t forget to apply for as many jobs as possible.</p>
<p>Taking on more and more interviews will offer more exposure to what you should expect from future interviews, how the hiring process is done, and how you will improve more.</p>
