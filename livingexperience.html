    Welcome, Neighbor.  

If you‚Äôre here, you‚Äôve heard it too.  

The engines roar, the windows shake,  
The peace we had, now theirs to take.  

This poem isn‚Äôt just words on a page‚Äîit‚Äôs the reality we live every day.  
The constant noise, the reckless behavior, and the silence of those who should help.  

So read on, and know you‚Äôre not alone.  

‚Äî A Concerned Neighbor  

---  

### The Roar of the Ride (And the Neighborhood That Doesn't Care)  

Each morning and night, without fail,  
A thunderous roar tears through the veil.  
The car so fierce, the engine loud,  
Revving high, disturbingly proud.  

Its engine growls, its tires screech,  
Peace and quiet‚Äîout of reach.  
Walls begin to shake,  
Dreams jolt awake.  

But this ride is not alone, you see,  
Another joins this loud symphony.  
A gold LeSabre, years gone by,  
Blasting past like it‚Äôs alive.  

One night, without a word or care,  
It pulled in a driveway, unaware.  
But wait‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt by mistake,  
They knew exactly what they‚Äôd make.  
Intentional, the noise they‚Äôd bring,  
Blasting sound with reckless sting.  

And if the engines weren‚Äôt enough,  
Fireworks came, loud and rough.  
Dropped so close, the lawns ablaze,  
Echoing through sleepless days.  

Through all this noise, those nearby stay,  
Silent, still‚Äîthey look away.  
One might say, with steady breath,  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt let it bother me‚Äù to death.  
But maybe fear‚Äôs the real refrain,  
Scared as hell, yet they remain.  

Then came a group, a rowdy crew,  
Dressed in uniforms, crisp and new.  
They made their way to bang on doors,  
And run away, causing uproar.  

Garage doors shook, their hands hit hard,  
A reckless thrill in the quiet yard.  
Lies dripped down, straight to our face,  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who, it wasn‚Äôt them,‚Äù  
But checks were cut, leaving guilt in place.  

Then another house, a tale untold,  
Engines roaring, peace set to fold.  
Neighbors asked, they spoke with care,  
Only to get a spiteful glare.  
Each complaint, they take as war,  
Talking back, defending more.  

And if the mess could end right there,  
Another sight still fills the air.  
A wooden pallet, left for months,  
Soaked by rain, just standing once.  
It might be gone, no longer there,  
But if you look, it‚Äôs still somewhere.  
Ugly, broken, left to decay,  
A piece of trash that‚Äôs in the way.  

Through all of this, authorities seem weak,  
The noise still reigns, the silence bleak.  
A year and a half, still the same,  
Yet action hides behind the blame.  
An officer sat at a meeting‚Äôs grace,  
Not to fix or enforce the case,  
But scowl at victims, worse and worse.  
We wish he had results to disperse.  

And what of the board, who ought to care?  
Useless, blind, they leave us there.  
They give their praise, their credit due,  
To a place of lies untrue.  
A toxic site, a hateful page,  
Run by one long out of the stage.  
No longer here, yet still in power,  
As rumors spread and neighbors sour.  

Through months and months, the pattern stays,  
Shattering nights, disrupting days.  
Is there an end? A hope? A chance?  
Or just more noise, a tireless dance?  

But justice waits with measured pace,  
Noise complaints soon take their place.  
May silence one day find its way,  
And let the restless sleep and stay.
